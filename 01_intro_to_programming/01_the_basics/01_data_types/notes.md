# Data Types

Data types let programmers know what they can and cannot do with a piece of data.

<br>

## Primitive Data Types

These are built in features of JavaScript that define pieces of data. Their inherent values cannot be mutated once created. Primitive data types are passed by value (a copy of the value is passed to a function rather than a reference to an object in memory):

- Number
- String
- Boolean
- Null
- Undefined
- BigInt
- Symbol

<br>

Every Data Type that is not a primitive is an Object Type.

<br>

## Literals

Data Type values are represented by literals - a notation / representation of a fixed value in source code. e.g.

- `'Hello World'` / String literal
- 3.141592 / Number literal
- true or false / Boolean literal
- {a: 1, b: 2} / Object literal 
- [1, 2, 3, 4] / Array literal 
- undefined / Undefined literal

<br>

## Strings

A list of characters represented by text inside double or single quotations. Examples of string literals can include:

- names: "Stephane"
- messages: "Hello, how are you?"
- descriptions: "Stephane is a wonderful person."

<br>

## Template literals

Make use of backticks using string interpolation whereby expression values can be merged within strings e.g. `The expression value will be interpolated here ${expression}`

<br>

## Numbers

The Number Data Type represents all real numbers (int, float, double, -negative and otherwise).

<br>

## Booleans

Booleans represent an on or off state to be true or false. They can be used with comparison operators to check the value of a condition. 

<br>

## Undefined

The absence of a value. When a variable is not defined it's value is undefined. The literal `undefined` can also be used as a value.

`console.log();` is an example of a function that returns undefined as there is no explicit return value, it only writes to the standard output stream (the console/terminal).

<br>

## Null

The intentional absence of value representing emptiness / nothing. Must be used explicitly if making use of it as a literal value. 

<br>

## TypeOf Operator

Use typeof to encounter the Data Type of a value.
