// Will an error occur if you try to access an array element with an index that is greater than or equal to the length of the array? For example:

let foo = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
console.log(foo.length);  // => 3
console.log(foo[3]);      // will this result in an error?

// No an error should not occur. Instead it should print undefined as the index in question is currently empty of a value and yet to be defined.
