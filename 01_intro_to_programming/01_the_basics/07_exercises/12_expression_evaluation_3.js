// What value does the following expression evaluate to?

// '12' < '9'

// This should evaluate to true because when two strings are compared the expression is evaluated from left to right on a character by character basis and thus '1' compared to being less than '9' which would be true and thus it determined that '12' is less than '9'.

console.log('12' < '9'); // true
