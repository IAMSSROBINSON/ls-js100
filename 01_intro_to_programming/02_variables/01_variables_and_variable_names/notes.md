# Variables and Variable Names

Variables are a descriptively named area of a programs memory space that allow for storage of information at that memory address so that it can be used, manipulated or changed. 

- They are containers that hold information
- They help to understand the program through naming

## Variable Naming

Variable names should accurately describe and identify the data the variable contains. 

- let, const and var variables
- object property names (not all object properties are variables only those on the global object)
- function names
- function parameters
- class names
