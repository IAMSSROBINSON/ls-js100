# Declaring Constants

The `const` keyword allows for declaring constant identifiers of which the value is immutable and cannot be assigned a new value. Const variables must be initialized with a value at declaration.

```JavaScript
const INTEREST_RATE = 0.0783;

// It is convention to identify const variable names in UPPERCASE_LETTERS separating words with an underscore 
```
