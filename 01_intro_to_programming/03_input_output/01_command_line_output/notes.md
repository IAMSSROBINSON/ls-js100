# Input / Output

Computers and software interact with the real world to solve problems. To do this computers take input from sources:

- keyboard
- mouse
- network
- environmental sensors
- voice

Inputs are typically changed or manipulated in some way and then output in a variety of ways:

- log to the console
- send input to another computer to output (login credentials)
- screen
- network

## Command Line Output

```JavaScript
let name = 'Jane';
console.log(`Good morning, ${name}`);
```

let (a block scoped variable identifier) is used to declare a variable called: name and initialize it to the primitive string value: 'Jane'.
A template literal is used to interpolate the expression value of the name variable within the output string.
