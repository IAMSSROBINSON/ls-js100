# Using Functions

Functions are a procedure that allows for extraction of some code as a separate unit to run multiple times if and where required.

## Defining a function

The `function` keyword is used to define a function and is followed up by the name of the function. 

The function name (which is also a variable who's value is the function object) should be of legal JavaScript convention (camelCase) and should be idiomatic (understood by developers as a description of the functions purpose): `function printGreeting`.

The function name is followed by a set of parenthesis which can be sent arguments and be represented as parameter values in this area: `function printGreeting()`.

A set of curly braces - this is the function body - follows the parenthesis and inside them goes the code associated with the function: ``function printGreeting () {}`

## Calling a function

A function call is a means by which to initiate the implementation of the code written within the function body.

To call a function, you state the function name followed by parenthesis: 
`printGreeting();`. The function is created at the time it is called and its values disappear after the function ends.

### Function Invocation / Invoke a function

When referring to a function or its use, use the term Function invocation e.g. This is a function invocation (noun). 

When referring to the action of calling a function, use the term invoke a function. To invoke a function is to call, execute a function and the statements within it (verb).
