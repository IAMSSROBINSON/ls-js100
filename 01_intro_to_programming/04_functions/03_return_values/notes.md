# Return Values

Functions can return a result / value to the call location (the place from where the function was invoked) for use in the program. 

<br>

## Implicit return value

All function have a return value. The implicit return value is `undefined` which is the absence of explicitly returning a value. 

<br>

## Explicit return value

The inclusion of explicitly providing a `return` statement using the `return` keyword followed by the value to return.

<br>

## Return statement

When JavaScript encounters the return statement it evaluates the expression, terminates the function and returns the expression value to the caller location. If no return statement is present then `undefined` is returned.

<br>

## Predicates

Functions that always returns a boolean true or false value are called predicates.
