# Functions and Scope

There are two types of variables based on there they are accessible within a program. This depends on the keyword used to declare the variable and where the variable declaration takes place within the program determines whether the variable is global or local.

## Global Variables 

Available throughout the entire program with global scope. You can read and reassign them at any time. If the variable is not declared inside a function or a block then it is a global variable. 

Sometimes it can be helpful to use a global variable but in general it is best to confine the scope of variables as much as possible to limit the risk of errors.

## Local Variables

Available within a function or block scope and thus has local scope. These variables cannot be accessed outside of the scope in which they were declared.
