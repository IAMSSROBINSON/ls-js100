# Functions VS Methods

<br>

## Function Invocation

Functions are invoked by stating the function name followed by parenthesis (within which 1 or more arguments can be passed into a function).

## Method Invocation

Methods are functions that are invoked from within an object. They are invoked by using dot notation on an object name and stating the property within the object that has the function as a valued thus completing the key : value pair combination.
