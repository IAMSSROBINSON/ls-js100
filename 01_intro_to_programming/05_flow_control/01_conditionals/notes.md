# Conditionals

A computer program is like a journey for data. During the journey data encounters situations that impact it, changing it forever. 

Data can take different paths on the journey leading to different roads based on the programs end goal. Taking the correct path is called the `Flow Control` and the path it takes will be based on the evaluation result of certain `conditions`.

## What is a conditional?

A conditional is a direction that data can take. The direction chosen will be based on whether certain conditions are met or not met. 

The simplest of conditions is an `if / else statement` which can use conditional operators:

`<` 
`>` 
`<=` 
`>=` 

comparison operators:

`==` 
`===` 

logical operator:

`!=` 
`&&` 
`||` 

to direct the flow of data.

## if / else if / else statement clause 

A `clause` is a block, statement, expression that executes when the condition in an if statement evaluates to true. If the condition evaluates to false then the program resumes with the first statement or expression after the if statement without running the code in the true clause. 

An `else clause` will run if the conditional evaluates to false thereby bypassing the true clause. This is part of the if statement.
