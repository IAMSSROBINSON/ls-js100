# Comparisons

Comparison operations return a boolean value: true or false;

<br>

## Operands

Expression / values that an operator uses are called operands - they will appear either side of the operator

<br>

## === Strict Equality operator / Identity Operator

Returns `true` when operands have the same data type and value otherwise returns `false`.

<br>

## !== Strict Inequality Operator

Returns `false` when operands have the same data type and value, or `true` otherwise (it returns the opposite of what the === operator would return).

<br>

## == Non-Strict Equality Operator / Loose Equality Operator

Compares operands for value and returns `true` if values are the same or `false` if not the same. If the first operand is different type it will try to coerce the 2nd into a the same type as the first and then make the comparison (it may even coerce both operands in some cases).

<br>

## != Non-Strict Inequality Operator / Loose Inequality Operator

Similar to !=== but when this operator compare different types it tries to coerce one to the same type as the other before comparison. When the values are the same `false` is returned otherwise `true` is returned. 

<br>

## < Less Than Operator

Returns `true` when left operand is less than the value of the right operand, otherwise it returns `false`.

<br>

## > Greater Than Operator

Returns `true` is the operand on the right is greater in value or evaluates to greater than the operand on the left, otherwise it returns `false`.

<br>

## <= Less Than or Equal To Operator

Returns `true is the operand on the left has a value that is less than or equal to in value to the operand on the right, otherwise it returns `false`.

<br>

## >= Greater Than or Equal To Operator

Returns `true` if the value of the left operand is greater than or equal to the value of the right operand, otherwise it returns `false`.
