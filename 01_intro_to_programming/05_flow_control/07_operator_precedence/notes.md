# Operator Precedence

Precedence rules are used to evaluate expressions that use multiple operators and sub-expressions.

The operators that have the highest precedence get evaluated first. If operators have equal precedence then expressions are evaluated from left to right. 

Parenthesis have the highest precedence so wrapped sub-expressions in parenthesis will mean it gets evaluated first.
