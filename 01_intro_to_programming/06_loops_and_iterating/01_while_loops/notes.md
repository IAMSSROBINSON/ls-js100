# Loops And Iterating

Loops are statement mechanisms that iterate execution over and over whilst a conditional expression is truthy until a stated change from within the execution block to the ending condition renders it falsy thus halting the loop execution.

The structure of a loop is a looping keyword, a condition and a following block.

## While Loops

Uses the `while` keyword followed by conditional expression and execution block body.

## Post Increment Operator ++ 

Returns the current value of a expression and then adds +1 after.
Only use this syntax in the clause of a loop, for everything else use += 1.

## ++ Pre Increment Operator

Increases the current value of the expression by +1 and then returns it.
Only use this syntax in the clause of a loop, for everything else use += 1.

## Post Decrement Operator --

Returns the current value of a expression and then decreases it by -1 after.
Only use this syntax in the clause of a loop, for everything else use -= 1.


## -- Pre Decrement Operator

Decreases the current value of the expression by -1 and returns then it.
Only use this syntax in the clause of a loop, for everything else use -= 1.

## Looping Over Arrays with while

Loops often iterate over an arrays elements and perform some action on each element. Iterate means to process each element action one at a time in sequence, from first to last. If a variable is declare and initialized inside a loop then it will be created, used and discarded on each iteration of the loop.

## Do While Loop

Do while loops execute the loop sequence at least once. The conditional expression check occurs at the end of the loop allowing it to run once first even if the condition is falsy when the loop begins.
