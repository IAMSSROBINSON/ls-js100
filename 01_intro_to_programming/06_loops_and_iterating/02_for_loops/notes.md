# For Loops

For loops are another iterating sequence mechanism. The For Loop combines variable initialization, a loop condition, and the variable increment/decrement expression all on the same line.

```JavaScript
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
  // loop body
}
```

The first line of code starts with the `for` keyword thereby starting a loop structure. 
Inside the loop clause in parenthesis a local variable is declared and initialized to a starting count/number; 

A conditional expression is stated and must evaluate to true to enter the loop body/block and execute any statements or expressions;

And lastly the variable is either incremented or decremented to direct the flow of iteration.
