# Controlling Loops

The keywords `continue` and `break` offer a way of controlling the flow of a loop.

`continue` allows for starting a new loop iteration by skipping the rest of the execution block and jumping ahead to the next iteration. Using `continue` is like using a negating if conditional.

`break` allows for terminating the loop early and skipping all remaining iterations of the loop.
