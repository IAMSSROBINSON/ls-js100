# Array Iteration

Iterating over array elements in ordered lists without loops.

## forEach()

The `forEach()` method can be invoked on an array and accepts an anonymous callback function expression as its argument. The `forEach()` method will return undefined and cannot return a different value therefore if performing an action on each element of the array it should be saved to a variable outside of the scope of the method block. forEach does not mutate the caller.
