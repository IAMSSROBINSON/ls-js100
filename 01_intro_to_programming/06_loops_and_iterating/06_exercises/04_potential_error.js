// Does the following code produce an error? Why or why not? What output does this code send to the console?

for (let i = 0; i < 5;) {
  console.log(i += 1);
}


/*

This code should not produce an error.

A for loop is initiated and within the clause a variable is declared and initialized to the value of 0.

A conditional statement evaluates whether the value of the variable is less than 5 and this evaluates to be true which is a truthy value and thus the block clause is executed.

In the body of the loop the console.log method is invoked and the additional assignment operator reassigns the value of the variable (previously initialized to 0) by increasing its value by +1. This expression value is then printed to the console.

The loop iterates and the conditional expression evaluates the expression with the new value of the variable. The expression evaluates to be truthy and once again the block clause is executed. The cycle repeats itself until the conditional expression of the loop clause evaluates to a falsy value and thus the output should print to the console the values:

1
2
3
4
5

The components of the loop are not all visible in one line but they are optional so as long as the loop can function and is not syntactically incorrect, it will function as it is written. It is not an issue that the incremental sequence of the loop takes place within the invocation of the console.log method, although it is strange - it still works.
