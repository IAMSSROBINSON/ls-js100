# ES6 and Beyond

JavaScript is ECMAScript

Arrow functions came from ES6 (ECMAScript 6)

The evolution of JavaScript means that some JavaScript environments may not be up to date and lack recent features. 
  - This lead to tools like Babel that let you write code in the latest language and back it backward compatible for older environments.
