// Add some code inside of the for loop below that logs the current value of i to the console on each iteration. Before you run the code: What sequence of numbers do you expect to be logged?

for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i += 2) {
  // include your code here
  console.log(i);
}

// The code should log the below numbers because the iterator expression should increase by +2 on each iteration from 0 to 10.
// 0
// 2
// 4
// 6
// 8
// 10
